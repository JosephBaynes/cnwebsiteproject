<h3>The premise of the show</h3>
<div>
    <p class="welcome"> Community is a television series Created by Dan Harmon and produced by Anthony and Joseph Russo that ran between 2009 and 2015, with the first 5 seasons originally airing on NBC and the sixth season airing on Yahoo.

    Set at a fictional college in Colorado called Greendale, it's about a recently disbarred lawyer, Jeff Winger having to go back to college after having foud to have lied about having a degree from Columbia University.
    After lying to a girl he likes, Britta Perry about having a Spanish study group in an attempt to spend time with her, she invites several other students from the class: Abed, Annie, Troy, Shirley and Pierce.
    Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.
    <br>
    The theme song for the show is "At Least it was Here by The 88. In addition to this, the score for the show throughout the series was written by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, who has since gone on to write the scores for The Mandalorian, Tenet and Black Panther for which he won an Oscar."

<h3>About the show</h3>
<div>
    <p class="humour_discussion">The series has a strong reliance on meta-humour and references to many different genres of film and television, all while mostly remaining in the setting of a community college. This includes Westerns, procedural police dramas, documentary films, stop-motion animated Christmas specials and zombie horror films. The majority of the show's episodes are named in the style of college courses, such as Anthropology 101, Contemporary American Poultry and Geography of Global Conflict.
</p>
    <p class="humour_discussion">The show also has a trend of being so familiar and aware of common television tropes that it will purposely deviate from the viewer's expectations. The best example of this is the episode Paradigms of Human Memory, where the premise appears to be that of an ordinary clip show, common among many television shows, but instead of showing clips from previously shown episodes, they are clips from adventures the study group has apparently been on that the viewer has not seen before.
    This level of understanding and appreciation of the medium it exists in is one of the reasons Community is one of my favourite television shows of all time and why it still has a cult following years later. In a recent BBC poll, Community was voted as the 44th greatest television show of the 21st century so far.
</p>   
<p class="humour_discussion">The other aspect of the show that I love is that it's a show about broken people. The study group is made up of people who aren't at where they would have hoped to have been in life, but they are brought together and find acceptance with each other and ultimately with themselves
</p>
<p class="humour_discussion">There has long been talk of a movie spin-off from the show, joked about as far back as season 3 when the show was at risk of getting cancelled with the hashtag of #SixSeasonsAndAMovie, but the likelihood of one is not clear. Many cast members have shown great interest in reprising their roles for a film, but it's reliant on Dan Harmon writing a script he approves on and recently he has been busy on other television shows, most notably Rick and Morty.</P>
