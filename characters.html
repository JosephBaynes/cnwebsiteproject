<h1>An Introduction to the main characters</h1>
<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Jeff Winger (Joel McHale)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="Jeff.jpg" alt="Jeff Winger">
    </div>
    <p>A former lawyer who enrols at Greendale Community College after being suspended by the state bar for falsely claiming to have a bachelor's degree from Columbia University. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, narcissist lothario who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. Jeff first originally created the study group to date Britta, not knowing that she would then invite other students from the class. As he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. Most of the study group (with the exception of Britta) tend to idolize Jeff for his charisma, and often seek advice from him. Although he initially dislikes his role as the group's straight man and tries to appear apathetic to their concerns before begrudgingly helping them, Jeff is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other "alpha-males" typically offer. The character of Jeff is partly inspired by Dan Harmon's friend Jeff Brian Davis who is an actor and comedian.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="Britta.jpg" alt="Britta Perry">
    </div>
    <p>An anarchist, atheist, and activist who travelled around the world after dropping out of high school, living in New York for a while. Britta attempts to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she often comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a therapist starting in Season 3. This has led the other group members to view Britta as being a negative influence on the group, as evidenced by her taste in mentally damaged men, and her tendency to make things go wrong, leading the rest of the group coining the phrase “to Britta” something to mean to ruin it. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta has a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced). Various aspects of Britta's personality are inspired by a former girlfriend of Dan Harmon, mostly in the way that she would get allegories and idioms confused, occasionally forming new and better ones in the process.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Abed Nadir (Dani Pudi)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="abed.jpg" alt="Abed Nadir">
        </div>
    <p>A film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via conventional means due to his implied autism, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV clichés. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behaviour and often the wisest member of the group. These eccentricities allow him to pick up on flaws the other characters have and tend to bluntly point them out, eventually resulting in the characters learning from his insights. The character is a fan of television show Cougar Town, at one point appearing as an extra in the show. Harmon based the character on his friend Abed Gheith who is a comedian.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Annie Edison (Alison Brie)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="annie.jpg" alt="Annie Edison">
    </div>
    <p>The youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively innocent. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to Adderall, which has caused her to be very anxious and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. Though normally kind-hearted, she can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about. However, her friendship with Jeff, as well as her living situation with Troy and Abed, slowly allow her to become more laid-back and genial.</p>
</div>
<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Troy Barnes (Donald Glover)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="troy.jpg" alt="Troy Barnes">
    </div>
    <p>A former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his nerdy and carefree side, particularly in him becoming best friends with Abed. Troy generally struggles with the idea of becoming older, often looking to Jeff and Pierce for guidance, despite already showing signs of being capable of leadership and connecting the group together. Troy very quickly becomes close friends with Abed and their friendship becomes a basis for a lot of the show's referential humour throughout the series. Donald Glover left the show in season 5 to focus on other projects like his music career where he performs under the name of Childish Gambino and to create his own television series Atlanta.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="shirley.jpg" alt="Shirely Bennett">
        </div>
    <p>A divorced mother and vocal Christian going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is a kind-hearted person with strong morals, but can be overbearing and often resorts to using guilt in her interactions with her friends. Though mostly soft-spoken, Shirley has a quick temper that manifests when she is advocating for herself or her friends. It is often implied that Shirley's Christian beliefs, which she tends to impose on most non-Christians around her, are a means of coping with her anger issues and to repress the stress she deals with in raising her family while also attending college. Shirley was a main part of the study group up until the end of season 5, when Yvette Nicole Brown had to leave the show to take care of her ill father. Despite this, she still managed to make a few guest appearances in the final season.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="pierce.jpg" alt="Pierce Hawthorne">
    </div>
    <p>A millionaire and CEO of the "Hawthorne Wipes" moist towel company who enrolled at Greendale a decade prior to the start of the series out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. More than anyone else within the study group, Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual ignorance of politically correct behaviour, all of which largely stem from his old age and his emotionally abusive father. This includes believing Britta is a closeted lesbian, mispronouncing Abed's name, and lusting over Shirley. He also tends to envy the other group members, particularly Jeff's relative youthful attractiveness and Abed's close friendship with Troy. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, showing that he does care for each of the group members. Chevy Chase played the role until season 4 where he quit part way through the season before being officially killed off-screen in season 5. While there are many accounts that Chevy was difficult to work with and that he didn't understand the show's sense of humour, some of his performances on the show are held to be some of the best acting work he's ever done.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Ben Chang (Ken Jeong)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="chang.jpg" alt="Ben Chang">
    </div>
    <p>An extremely unstable Spanish teacher at Greendale. Chang often takes extreme action against his students, usually yelling at them for the slightest infraction or fervently using his superior status to taunt. He has alternately been a friend and foe of the study group, his ultimate desire being to fit in with them, though his behaviour makes them desperate to not include him. After Annie gets him fired at the end of Season 1, Chang alternates a variety of roles, becoming a student in Season 2, a security guard in Season 3, and finally a maths teacher under work release from Season 5. Fun fact: Ken Jeong himself is a qualified medical doctor, but no longer practices in favour of his acting career.</p>
</div>
<div class=charactercontainer>
    <p class="characterbio">Dean Craig Pelton (Jim Rash)</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img class="resize" src="dean.jpg" alt="Dean Pelton">
</div>
    <p>The dean of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions. A man of questionable sexual orientation, he frequently attempts to flirt with Jeff and is an increasingly avid cross-dresser. The study group is by far the Dean's favourite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to come talk to them, often by walking into their study room unannounced while wearing an unnecessarily elaborate costume in order to tell them about events going on in the school. In addition to being an actor, Jim Rash is an accomplished writing having written several films scripts, including the 2010 film The Descendants for which he won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p>

<div class=charactercontainer>
<p >In addition to the main cast there were also many recurring background characters, mainly other students or professors at the college. Though mostly supporting parts, having a recurring group of extras helped the feeling that it was a small community college. There have also been a number of famous guest stars on the show, including John Oliver, Jonathan Banks, John Goodman, Brie Larson and the late Michael Kenneth Williams. It's also worth noting that since the Russo Brothers were producers of the show, many members of the main cast have had cameo appearances in MCU movies.</p>
